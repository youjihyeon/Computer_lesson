## single cell methodology
### writing and reading genome : functional genomic study with  CRISPR and single-cell sequencing
- Deeper analysis 
-   functional genomic study
### scLENS : data-driven signal detection for unbiased scRNA-seq data analysis
-  PCs contain various things -> select column ->  random matrix -> L2 norm

### developing data infrastructure and 
-  quantitatively, positional information
-  spaital technology
-   visium

### compuational generation of novel GFP-binding nanobodies
-   proteingMPNN
-   RFdiffusion generated backbone structure are provided for template
-   hypothesis : if predicted structures of designed sequence are consistenet with designed backbones those sequences would be more reliable.

### de novo design of protein nanostructures
- 다양한 구조(자연에서) : Nanocages, virus capsid 등등
-   Geometry of the protein nanostructures
-   goal : desgin principle-> de novo protein design -> experimental vaildation

-   design of de novo protein nanocages(OD)

-  Icosahedral virus capsid -> diverse size
-   what is different t number? -> local symmetry breaking is the key
  -  how to break symmetry
    -  1. programmable assembly
  -   experimental validations of oligomers
    -  de novo homo-trimer -(heteromerization)-> de novo hetero trimer
-   application
  -   cell internalization
    -  asgpr ligand와 결합 -> hep3b 형성 -> 
-   secondary  protein design approach
  -   parameterizaition of the interaction between 
    -  hexagon only and pentagon only
    -  protein design for a given parameter set
      -  negative stain EM for 1-comp high-T cages

### when structure prediction meets cryo EM
-  Protein structure prediction
  -  trRossetta : transforma-restrained rosetta
  -  casp15 ranking 
-  cryo-EM structure determination
  -  step1. predict Ca atoms by U-Net
  -  step2. predict all- atom structures by cry-net
    -  key differnet
      -  local attension
      -  3d~
  -  step3. cry fold vs modelangelo
    -   cryfold build missing structures
    -  cryfold works well for ultra-large complex

### design principle in inflammation and fibrosis
