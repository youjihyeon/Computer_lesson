1. ability to leverage diverse carbon source

ancient biology -> inhospitable enviroment
biology co2 fixation routes -wood ljungdahl pathway -  . high energy efficiency

anaerobic acetogens : wood lfungdahl pathway
-  conversion of two molecules of CO OR CO2 TO 
-   most actegens synthesis acetate as sole product,  but some can make other product such as ethanols.

first step toward an industia strain : adaptive lab evolution 
next: developing a genetic toolbox -> DNA transfer, genetic part , genetic toools, gene editing.
otimizing strain  performance: reverse engineering, multi omics

optimizating strain performance
expanding the product portfolio: metabolic engineering
-  production of c3-c4 platform chemicals

enzyme idendification : mining a historic stratin collection
signification variant identify

pathway optimaization optimization : combinationial library
